      <p>
        <p>I set out to revolutionize the fitness industry with cutting-edge technology at <a href="https://mygymassistant.com">My Gym Assistant</a>. We developed a mobile app, web-panel, and turnstile control system, utilizing the latest technologies to make it easy to manage a gym. I was responsible both for the development of software and business development, and I was able to grow the company from a single gym to over 25 gyms and 7 cities in 2 years.</p>
        <br />
After a while, I continue to bring that same level of ambition and expertise to my work as a full-time developer on a Magento Agency. I have completed two major projects and am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to push the boundaries of what's possible in web development. With a passion for technology and a commitment to excellence, I am excited to see what the future holds.</p>
